
## ChatBot 

The code is working fine. We need to update the existing data and add new data based on our project requirements.

    
## Installation

To install PyTorch for training the data
```bash
  pip install torch
```

To install Flask for running your project
```bash
  pip install flask
```
To install NLTK for Torch dependencies
```bash
  pip install nltk
```
NLTK library, which can be used for various natural language processing tasks. It may be useful for preprocessing text data before training with PyTorch.   

Install torchvision and torchaudio separately due to potential compatibility issues
```bash
  pip install torchvision
  pip install torchaudio
```
## follow the steps


- Run the default.py   -- We need to set up the project dependencies 
- Run the train.py     -- We need to train the model
- Run the chat.py      -- Then start running the application
